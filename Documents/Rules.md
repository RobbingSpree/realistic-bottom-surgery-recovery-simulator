Players have 2 values:

- Stamina
- Limit

A player's stamina is how many dice they can roll in a turn and starts at 3.

Their limit is the size of the dildo they can fit inside them and starts at 1.

A player's goal is to complete their bottom surgery recovery therapy before everyone else (because getting a good grade in bottom surgery recovery is a normal to want and a possible thing to achieve).

A player will be in possession of up to 2 things

- Dildo collection
- Complications

The dildo collection starts at one dildo, and players must roll a dice total higher than the requirement on the dildo for the nurses to allow you to advance to the next dildo. Finishing the 7th dildo in a collection is what allows a player to finish the game

Players can roll their dice one at a time if they want since if they succeed at passing the first dildo they can try at their next one on the same turn.

Complications are given to a player if they roll one or more 1’s on their turn (but if you roll all your dice at once you only get one complication regardless of the number of 1’s you roll cause it says 1 or more). A complication will have a dice value on it, a player will resolve their complication if they roll exactly the number it asks for, bit that dice won't count to their total for a dildo.
