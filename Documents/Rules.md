Realistic bottom surgery recovery simulation

A dice game (with scrap paper for notes)

The Game requires: 

- many 6 sided dice
- scrap paper for each player to keep track of their values and complications

Players have 2 values:

- Stamina
- Limit

A player's stamina is how many dice they can roll in a turn and starts at 3.
Players can roll their dice in any number at a time. 
However to reaise a player's stamina they need to roll at least two dice at once, since when a player rolls a pair with the same result or a triple of the same result they can remove those dice from their results and increase their stamina such they can roll 1 additional dice next turn by removing a pair of the same result or raise it by two by removing three of a kind (if you are lucky enough to roll foure of a kind or higher that can be treated as several pairs or triples).
The exception to this is the number 1. The first 1 in any roll is ignored and any future 1's rolled are treated as 0 when adding the total together.

A player's Limit is the size of the dildo they can fit inside them and starts at 1 and is raised by rolling a total greater than the threshold for their dilator level. 

If a player manages to pass their current check with some dice remaining they can choose to move on to the next check with their remaining die and roll what's left, however they will start the count for their total roll from zero again (as when IRL dilating in surgery recovery you need to wait 30 minutes to an hour before attempting the next size up of dilator so you don't get to ride the wave of success).

A player's goal is to complete their bottom surgery recovery therapy before everyone else (because getting a good grade in bottom surgery recovery is a normal to want and a possible thing to achieve).

A player can come into posession of an additional thing:

- Complications

Complications are given to a player if one or more of the dice show 1’s during a roll. If a player rolls each dice indervidually and each dice is a 1 they get three complications. If they roll all three dice at once and all three are 1's they get 1 complication (and can remove the remaining pair of 1's to increase their stamina).
A complication will have a dice value from 2-6, a player will resolve their complication if they roll exactly the number it asks for, but that dice won't count to their total for a dilator check. (This can be shown by rolling the 1 results again and noting down what they show (rerolling again if the player gets another 1))


(This table breaks in some markdown editors)

| Dildo level | Dice total needed to pass | Percentile Equivalent | Dilator diameter for IRL recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 10 | 28% fails on 3d6 | 0.125” |
| 2 | 12 | 66% fails on 3d6 | 0.25” |
| 3 | 14 | 50% fails on 4d6 | 0.375” |
| 4 | 20 | 40% fails on 6d6 | 0.5” |
| 5 | 24 | 68% fails on 6d6 | 0.6125” |
| 6 | 30 | 40% fails on 9d6 | 0.75” |
| 7 | 36 | 66% fails on 9d6 | 0.8725” |

The game ends when any player clears dilator 7's dice check. All other players then congratulate them and comment on what they like most about the winner's neo-vagina.

If you have pervert friends you can replace the dice rolls with actual dilators.
