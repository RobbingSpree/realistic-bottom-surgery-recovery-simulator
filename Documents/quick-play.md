You have two trackable stats:

- Stamin (number of dice you can roll in your turn) starts at 3
- Limit (the size of the dilator you can take) starts at 1

During your turn you can roll any number of dice up to your stamina in any groupings. If the total of all unremoved dice at any point is greater than the current limit you're on: you can advance to the next and reset your total to 0.

You can raise your stamina by removing doubles or triples from rolls of two or more dice. Removed dice don't add to the total. You don't get the extra dice from increased stamina till next turn. You can only pick doubles or triples from dice rolled together.

You can raise your limit by rolling dice with total face value that equals or beats the values in the below tables.

1's don't count for totals and are treated as 0. 

The first 1 in every roll gets you a complication.

Complications remove themself and the first dice that matches their value that you roll.

Equal or beat the value for the 7th limit first to win.

| 2 | 12 |
| 3 | 14 |
| 4 | 20 |
| 5 | 24 |
