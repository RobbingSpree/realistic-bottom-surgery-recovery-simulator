A complication card is comprised of 4 elements
- a number from 2-6 (more often lower numbers)
- a bit of flavour text of what the complication is
- the real life expected recovery time for that complication
- an extra bit of flavour text (who doesn't like double flavour text)

Once in have time to do more maths this will include the statistical spread of how complications impact play.
For print and play, print off 5 copies of this list and shuffle them for players to use instead of rolling dice to learn their complication.
Still need to do the research on IRL recovery times, cause there's surprisingly not a lot of details on bottom surgery recovery. If you've had bottom surgery reach out with how long it took you to recoevr from any of these.

Deck list for now

| Name                                         | Number | IRL recovery | Extra flavour                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Constipation                                 | 2      |              | Prevents dilation due to inflammation or impacted material and incredible pain |
| Stitch tear                                  | 2      |              | The lube was red before you started, right?                                    |
| Infection in stitches                        | 2      |              | Honestly, I can't even tell it's more swollen from this angle.                 |
| Looked at your neo vagina funny and threw up | 2      |              | It is freshly seuchered flesh, it won't look pretty for months                 |
| Unable to fart                               | 3      |              | There's only so much space inside you and the dilator wants to take up a lot of it  |
| Pain                                         | 3      |              | Did you know pain hurts                                                        |
| Lack of sleep                                | 3      |              | Everything about surgery recovery is aided by sleep but you have to dilate often    |
| Sore back                                    | 4      |              | Raise those hips. More. More! MORE! Ohh, you're in a lot of pain? More?        |
| Got lube everywhere                          | 4      |              | How are you gonna hold on to what is essentially a bar of wet soap? You're exhausted and tired and now you have to clean up.           |
| Tore off a scab                              | 5      |              | Does the blood still count as inside if it's inside the neovagina?             |
| Internal bruising                            | 5      |              | Yeah, just keep poking that bit. That's when you know it's gone deep enough.   |
| Dilator broke while inside                   | 6      |              | The nurses fetched it with specilars but that is all you can feel now. yay :(    |
