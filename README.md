# realistic-bottom-surgery-recovery-simulator
A board game about recovering from vaginoplasty

While educational, the goal of this game is to make vaginoplasty (feminizing bottom surgery) more comfortable and idea and make it easier to talk about. Let's be awkward for 20 minutes while playing the silly game and then have a frank discussion later.

A game for every egg, their mom, and the lesbians who love them.
