Stamina was reworked to be a self contained mechanic that interacts with rolling for results to allow players to self-sabotage their current roll to make a future turn easier.

Document probably needs clearer termanology, I fear I use roll too often to mean either the total pool of dice that have been rolled or the current number of dice being rolled that will be added to that total

There's a bit too easy of a pull towards rolling all dice at once in the early game to farm for doubles and triples. But I think with the addition of other players the desire to win will even that out and encourage a rickier play to try and spend a farmed turn later rolling indervidual dice to clear more than one limit in a turn and get burned by the complications
