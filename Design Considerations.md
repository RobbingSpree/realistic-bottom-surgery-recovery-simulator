Stamina needs an upper limit, and probably a print and play element for tracking
Dildo collection can be represented by cut up skewers for print and play (otherwise a 2 card reveal tracker)
Need mechanism to raise or lower stamina (perhaps as a re-roll resource)
Dildo table needs a way to be passed with the minimum number of available dice
Stamina is currently the only value that's unrelated to dildo Level (it is also the only other value)
